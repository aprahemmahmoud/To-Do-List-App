<h1>Todo App</h1>

A simple yet fully functional Todo application built using vanilla JavaScript.
This project represents an important milestone in my journey of understanding the DOM, data handling, and implementing complete CRUD operations using localStorage.

<h2>🚀 Overview</h2>

This Todo app allows users to:

Add tasks

Edit tasks

Delete specific tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Save tasks permanently using localStorage

The project is built entirely with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — no frameworks.

<h2>🧠 What I Learned</h2>

While building this app, I went through several challenges that helped me understand JavaScript on a deeper level.

Mastering the DOM

In the beginning, the DOM felt complicated because of the huge number of details and methods.
I struggled to decide which methods to use and how to manage elements efficiently.
Eventually, I updated the way I work with DOM methods and learned to use cleaner, more modern approaches.

Deleting and Updating Specific Items

One of the hardest parts was removing or updating a specific task.
Understanding how to track items, identify them correctly, and update both the UI and localStorage took effort.
But once the logic became clear, everything turned simple.

Working with Local Storage

I also struggled with updating and syncing data in localStorage.
After spending more than a week understanding the theory and experimenting, everything became clear.
I was able to implement full CRUD operations without copying anyone else's code.

<h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>

<h2>🎯 Conclusion</h2>

This project improved my DOM skills, strengthened my understanding of JavaScript logic, and helped me implement CRUD operations confidently from scratch.
It stands as an important achievement in my frontend learning journey.
